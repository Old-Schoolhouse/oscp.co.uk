		<h2>How to find Us</h2>
		<p>Whether you're travelling by car, public transport or on foot, the Old Schoolhouse is easy to find.</p>
		<h3>Walking from Huyton Village Bus Terminus</h3>
		<p>From the bus terminus walk along Huyton Hey Road (away from the shopping centre). Pass under the railway bridge and continue to the end of the road where there is a crossroads with traffic lights. Turn right onto St. John’s Road. The Old Schoolhouse is a little way down this road (on the left) after the new housing development. It is a walk of approximately half a mile (10 minutes).</p>
		<h3>By Bus</h3>
		<p>The number 7 bus and the 61 both pass along St. John’s Road 
		(Request the St.Agnes' Road stop - this is just opposite our building).</p> 
		<p>Alternatively, there are many buses that will take you to the main bus terminus in Huyton village. From there you can follow the walking directions given above or take a taxi.</p>
		<h3>By train</h3>
		<p>The nearest station is Huyton. From there it is a short walk through the subway to the main bus terminus. Walking directions from there are given above.</p>

		<p><b>Overflow Parking</b></p>
		<p>Parking at the Old Schoolhouse is limited. Thankfully we are able to use the carparks belonging to nearby parish church of St. Agnes'. 
		If you know that your meeting is going to be busy you may prefer to head straight for one of these carparks and then walk across. The first is located on Huyton Hey Road (L36 5SF) and the second is on St. Mary's Road (L36 5SR).<br>
